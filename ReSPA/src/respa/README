IMPORTANT NOTE: This work is yet to be published. Awaiting acceptance




There are some features of REAP that were not uploaded yet, and some others are not yet implemented. This work should
be complete by Feb 2013, however many features are already available.

Not implemented (yet) features:

 - Xml files are already supported, but others like html, csv, many others, will be supported as well
 - Pure entropy leak estimation is not yet possible
 - MultiPathPrivacy (MPP) work is not implemented yet. 

Implemented but not yet uploaded: 

 - verbose mode is being tested
 - logging is disabled
 - Some input detection features, like command line input, need some changes
 - In the state labeling, the loop labeling needs some changes. This means that, at this time, REAP does not distinguish
 		between milestones within different iterations of loops. It will be uploaded soon. 
 		
 
 
 It is important to understand that REAP has many properties that depend on the application under test. These values 
 need to be specified a priori in the target_application.properties file, and may differ a lot. REAP may also need 
 additional implementation to support other type of applications.
